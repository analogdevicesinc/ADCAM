## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the ADI **ADCAM Camera Kit**, which is built around the **ADTF3175D Time-of-Flight (ToF) Mega-Pixel imager** and the **ADSD3500 Depth ISP**.  

The ADCAM hardware interfaces with the **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit** over **MIPI CSI-2** for image data, and uses **USB-C** solely for power. Unlike the earlier **ADTF3175D Evaluation Kit**, the ADCAM introduces two key improvements:

* **Dual ADSD3500 Depth ISPs**  
  Depth computation is fully handled by hardware, eliminating the need for proprietary SoC-based depth processing libraries. The only exception is the radial-to-XYZ (point cloud generation) step, which is implemented in the open-source [`libaditof`](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libaditof/tree/main) library.
* **Optimized for Jetson Orin Nano**  
  Designed specifically to operate on the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Developer Kit platform.

This repository depends on the following components:

* [**ToF-drivers**](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ToF-drivers/tree/main)  
  Provides the V4L2 camera sensor driver for the ADSD3500 Depth ISP, along with device tree sources and kernel patches as required.
* [**libaditof**](https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libaditof/tree/main)  
  Provides the SDK supporting the ADCAM system, integrating ADSD3500 Depth ISP processing with the ADI ToF imager.

## Building the Eval Kit

Note, prior to committing to the repo it is important to format the source code, see the [code formatting](doc/code-formatting.md) document.

### Standard Build

### Pre-requisites
* CMake
* g++
* Python 3 - note, we are assuming Python 3.8 in this document, change as needed for your setup
* OpenCV - for the examples
* OpenGL - for the examples
* Doxygen - for documentation generation
* Graphviz - for documentation generation

#### Installing the pre-requisites
```console
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake g++ \
     libopencv-contrib-dev libopencv-dev \
     libgl1-mesa-dev libglfw3-dev \
     doxygen graphviz
```

For Linux builds install the necessary version of Python dev libraries. For example for Ubuntu 22.04 with Python 3.10 as the default Python:
```console
sudo apt install python3.10-dev
```
### Building the SDK
```
git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/ADCAM.git
cd ADCAM
git submodule update --init
git checkout <branch or tag>
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make -j4
```
